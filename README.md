# :rainbow: RandomizeGradient
[RandomizeGradient](https://d0tcom.github.io/RandomizeGradient/) is a HTML, CSS and Javascript (vanilla) website that allows you to generate a gradient of two totally random colors.

## Features
### Done
- [x] Mobile responsive (this was designed for mobile first)
- [x] Randomize gradient! button
- [x] Copy / Paste feature of the two colors

### Features ideas
- [ ] Choose the number of colors in the gradient (maximum 5)

- [ ] Rotate the gradient
- [ ] Filter the gradients by color (red, blue, green, yellow etc.)
